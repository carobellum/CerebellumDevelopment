# CerebellumDevelopment
Repository for the project on cerebellar functional development across the lifespan. 


## Coverage review
We need to make sure that the functional and anatomical scans cover the cerebellum in full. When inspecting the scans, please  enter your assessment of the cerebellar coverage (full/partial/none) into the 'coverage' column and your initials in the 'review' column of the participants.tsv file. You can also add anything you want to mention about this scan in the notes column.


## Downloading
If the dataset is downloaded and available on Juseless, the participant.tsv file should indicate this in the 'downloaded' column.
